          “The best things in life are the people we love, the places we’ve
          been, and the memories we’ve made along the way.”
          <br /><br />
          When did you last participate in an adventurous sport? These adventure
          sports quotes may help you to remember memories. While some of us
          still view travel as an adventure, many of us give up our sense of
          adventure while we are young. It can seem like a lifetime ago when we
          were adventuring to new locations, climbing trees, and setting up camp
          under the stars. However, things always don’t have to be that way! Any
          exciting experience that involves taking a calculated risk is
          considered as an adventure. There are a growing variety of ways to
          test yourself and ignite your sense of adventure, from traveling and
          discovering new places to extreme sports like scuba diving, sky
          diving, paragliding, desert camping, rafting, hiking, mountain
          climbing, and more.

          <h2 class="description">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Mountain biking is a sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over
          rough terrain, usually using specially designed mountain bikes.
          Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate
          features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough
          terrain, such as air or coil-sprung shocks used as suspension, larger
          and wider wheels and tires, stronger frame materials, and mechanically
          or hydraulically actuated disc brakes. Mountain biking can generally
          be broken down into five distinct categories: cross country, trail
          riding, all mountain (also referred to as "Enduro"), downhill, and
          freeride.
          <br /><br />
          This sport requires endurance, core and back strength, balance, bike
          handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep
          technical descents and high-incline climbs. In the case of freeride,
          downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both
          natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps

          <h2 class="description">PARAGLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
          harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing
          shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air
          entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of
          the air flowing over the outside.
          <br /><br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="description">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
          <br /><br />
          Most modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or
          more wooden strips or "stringers", fiberglass cloth, and polyester
          resin (PE). An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded
          Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional
          PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as
          carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with
          fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards
          are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE
          board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to
          paddle and faster in the water.
